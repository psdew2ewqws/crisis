# AEGIS — General Crisis-Solving Brain

> A graph-based, deer-flow-style multi-agent system that takes **any** crisis case, connects every signal in a dependency graph, finds the **root cause**, and produces a **validated solution** — demonstrated end-to-end on the *Jordan Crisis Management Simulation Engine* scope, with a working React command-center dashboard.

This repository contains the full body of work: a specification gap analysis, a domain-agnostic system blueprint, a technical engine spec, a deep System Requirements document, an MVP definition, and a **running frontend** — the **AEGIS Crisis Console** dashboard.

## The dashboard (live MVP UI)

The **AEGIS Crisis Console** is the operator dashboard: a left command rail (operations + active cases), at-a-glance KPI cards, a live signal-volume chart, and a tabbed signals / incidents / solutions table — all driven by the Zarqa demo case (no backend required).

- **KPIs** — National Risk (84, ▲ +12, critical), Apex Confidence (0.91, PyRCA — `PIPE-ZN-44` isolated, loud symptoms demoted), Projected Risk (22, ▼ −62, validated fix holds), Time to Mitigate (35 min — isolate + bypass + tanker).
- **Signal Volume** — 911 call rate & pressure anomalies for Zarqa North: a flat baseline ramping into the cascade onset.
- **Signals table** — per-entity observations with severity, Δ value, Z-score and time. The quiet `PIPE-ZN-44` pressure drop is the true root cause behind the loud 911/hospital spikes.

## Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Built with **React 18 + TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Recharts · lucide-react**. No backend needed — it ships with the Zarqa demo fixtures in `src/lib/data.ts`.

## How it works

The brain runs one domain-agnostic loop; a **Domain Pack** (ontology, propagation rules, connectors, intervention library, simulator) plugs in per domain — water is one pack, public-health and power-grid are others.

```
Ingest → Resolve → Correlate → Root-Cause → Risk → Generate-Solution → Validate → Recommend → Learn
   │         │          │           │          │            │              │           │         │
 signals  entity     stitch     causal-     cascade     intervention    re-sim     human     outcome
          resolution  incident   graph apex  propagate   library        on graph   gate      feedback
```

A **deer-flow-style agent swarm** drives it: *coordinator → planner → [graph-builder · correlator · root-cause · solution-generator · simulator-validator] → adversarial critic → human gate → reporter*, on a LangGraph runtime.

**A solution is "valid"** iff it (a) targets the root cause not symptoms, (b) is simulated to reduce the risk index, (c) is feasible (resources/authority/time), (d) bounds second-order harm, and (e) carries confidence + evidence lineage.
